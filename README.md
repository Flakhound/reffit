reffit: Referrals on Reddit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/winsonluk/reffit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/winsonluk/reffit)
===========================

Reffit is a natural language recommendation bot that applies predictive analysis on the social networking website Reddit to determine users who are actively inquiring for product suggestions, then builds a persuasive recommendation of a relevant and highly-rated Amazon product by intelligently synthesizing the product's price, description, and reviews.


Detecting User Inquiry
----------------------
The clearest indication of a user's readiness to purchase can be found in the subreddit (an organized categorical area of interest within Reddit) that a user's comment is written in. Examples of subreddits with high purchasing activity include BuyItForLife, where users ask for suggestions of products that last a lifetime, and MaleFashionAdvice (and its twin FemaleFashionAdvice), where users may purchase clothing they deem fashionable.
